# Frisquet Connect

## Overview

This integration links Gladys to your **Frisquet boiler** fitted with the **Frisquet Connect
box**, through the same online service as the "Frisquet Connect" app. In Gladys you get:

- every **heating zone** (Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3 depending on your installation) with its room
  temperature, its setpoint, its comfort / reduced / frost protection setpoints and its mode;
- the **boiler**: outdoor temperature (when a probe is fitted), domestic hot water (on / off and
  mode), alarms, holiday mode, standby and **gas used** for heating and hot water;
- a dashboard **widget** to change modes in one tap, **scene actions** and a **trigger** on alarms.

A community integration, **not affiliated with Frisquet**. Frisquet Connect has no public API: the
integration speaks the language of the official app, after the work of the projects credited in
the README. **Developed without the hardware nor an account: feedback welcome**, especially if a
mode or a command does not behave as in the app.

## Requirements

- A Frisquet boiler with the **Frisquet Connect box** installed and paired.
- An account in the **Frisquet Connect** app (e-mail and password) that sees your boiler.
- Gladys Assistant **5.2.0 or later** (the zone mode uses the thermostat presets added in 5.2.0).
- Internet access for Gladys: everything goes through Frisquet's online service, nothing through
  the local network.

## Configuration

1. In Gladys, **Integrations → Frisquet Connect → Configuration**.
2. Enter the **e-mail** and **password** of the Frisquet Connect app.
3. Pick the **language of the names** (French by default). Feature names are fixed when you add a
   device: change the language first.
4. Pick the **refresh interval**: every 5 minutes (default), 10 or 15 minutes.
5. Save, then click **Test the connection**: the message gives the number of boilers and zones
   found.
6. **Discover** tab: add the boiler and the zones you want.

If your account holds several boilers (a house and a flat, for instance), all of them show up; the
name of each zone then starts with the name of its installation.

## What each device does

### The boiler

| Feature                     | What it shows or does                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outdoor temperature         | The outdoor probe, when one is fitted.                                        |
| Hot water                   | Hot water on / off. "On" restores the last mode used.                         |
| Hot water mode              | MAX, Eco, Eco scheduled, Eco+, Eco+ scheduled, Off (depending on the boiler). |
| Alarm / Alarm active        | The text of the alarm shown by Frisquet, and a yes / no indicator.            |
| Holiday mode                | On while a holiday is scheduled and running (read-only).                      |
| Boiler on standby           | The boiler is on standby.                                                     |
| Heating gas / hot water gas | Gas used this month and this year, in kWh, as counted by Frisquet.            |

Installer notes (a standing reminder about underfloor heating, for instance) are not faults: they
are ignored.

### The heating zones

| Feature                                       | What it shows or does                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Room temperature                              | The temperature measured by the room sensor of the zone.                                                                                      |
| Setpoint                                      | The setpoint applied right now. Changing it changes the setpoint of the running mode (comfort or reduced), for good, as in the app.           |
| Comfort / reduced / frost protection setpoint | The three setpoints of the zone, from 5 to 30 °C in 0.5 °C steps.                                                                             |
| Mode                                          | **Schedule** (follows the weekly programme), permanent **Comfort**, **Reduced** or **Frost protection**. In Gladys, "Reduced" shows as "Eco". |
| Override running                              | An override is active (a mode forced until the next change of the programme).                                                                 |
| Boost                                         | Only when the zone offers it: a temporary heating boost.                                                                                      |
| Current mode                                  | A sentence: "Comfort (schedule)", "Reduced (override)", "Frost protection (holiday)"…                                                         |

Choosing **Schedule** also ends a running override.

## Pace, delays and quotas

- The Connect box relays the state of the boiler to Frisquet's service **by radio, every few
  minutes**. Reading more often would bring nothing: the integration reads every 5 minutes by
  default (10 or 15 if you prefer), and the gas consumption (monthly) every 6 hours.
- The service accepts a command at once, but the boiler only applies it at its next exchange with
  the box: **allow a few minutes**. Gladys shows the requested value at once, then the integration
  reads the boiler again 20 seconds and 3 minutes later.
- The service limits the number of requests: the integration spaces its calls by half a second at
  least and only reads the boilers with a device added to Gladys. After a refused password it waits
  30 minutes before trying again on its own (so as not to lock your account); fixing the
  configuration starts over at once.
- A value that does not change is published again every 6 hours, so Gladys does not flag it as
  old.

## Widget

Add the **Frisquet heating** widget to a dashboard.

- **Without a setting** (or with a boiler): every zone at a glance, the temperature and setpoint of
  each, and one line per zone with its current mode.
- **With a zone chosen**: its live temperature and setpoint, the current mode, the comfort /
  reduced / frost protection setpoints, the outdoor temperature, and four buttons: **Schedule**,
  **Comfort**, **Reduced** and **Override** (which reverses the running period until the next
  change of the programme, like the override key of the boiler) or **End override**. The active
  mode carries a tick.

Frost protection has no button in the widget, so an unlucky tap never cuts the comfort: choose it
on the device or with a scene.

## Scenes

### Trigger

- **Frisquet boiler alarm** — a new alarm appeared on the boiler (fault, Connect box
  disconnected…). Pick the boiler, or leave it empty for all. The text of the alarm is in the
  "Alarm" variable. An alarm already there at install or restart triggers nothing.

### Actions

- **Frisquet heating mode** — pick a zone, or a boiler for all its zones, and the mode: back to the
  schedule, permanent comfort / reduced / frost protection, comfort or reduced until the next
  change (override), or end of the override.
- **Frisquet hot water** — pick the boiler and the mode: On (last mode used), Off, MAX, Eco, Eco
  scheduled, Eco+, Eco+ scheduled.

Setpoints are set with the standard "Control a device" action of Gladys.

## Scene examples

- **Weekend away**: when the house alarm switches to away mode, **Frisquet heating mode** on the
  boiler with "Frost protection, permanent", then **Frisquet hot water** on "Off". On the way back,
  "Back to the schedule" and "On".
- **Home earlier than planned**: when your phone comes back to the home area on a weekday,
  "Comfort until the next change" on the living room zone.
- **Warn about a fault**: trigger **Frisquet boiler alarm**, then a Telegram message "Boiler:
  {{triggerEvent.data.alarm}}".
- **Off-peak hours**: at 10 pm, reduced setpoint 17 °C; at 6 am, comfort setpoint 20 °C ("Control
  a device" action).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Frisquet Connect refused the e-mail or the password"**: check them by signing in to the
  Frisquet Connect app, then fix the configuration.
- **"Frisquet Connect does not answer"**: the service is down or under maintenance; the
  integration tries again on its own. The alarm "Box Frisquet Connect déconnectée" means the box no
  longer reaches the Internet (box unplugged, Wi-Fi down).
- **A command changes nothing**: wait a few minutes (see the delays above). If the value comes back
  to the old one after 5 minutes, report it with the logs.
- **"No recent value"** on the gas consumption: your account may not provide it; everything else
  works without.
- **Logs**: in normal operation the integration writes nothing. For the details, set `LOG_LEVEL`
  to `debug`. The token and the password never appear in the logs.

## Limits

- **Developed without the hardware nor an account**: the answers of the service come from other
  community projects that recorded them on real boilers. Feedback welcome.
- **Holiday mode** is read-only: how to schedule it through the service is not documented. Set it
  in the app or on the boiler, or use "Frost protection, permanent".
- The **override** is a command without a zone number in Frisquet's service: on a multi-zone
  installation it may apply to zone 1 or to every zone, depending on the boiler. To be checked at
  home.
- The **weekly programme** cannot be edited from Gladys (only followed).
- The **gas consumption** is the one Frisquet computes, per month: it is not a gas meter, and it is
  not sent to the energy monitoring of Gladys, which would count it as electricity.
- The **hot water mode** of solar installations is not handled.
- Everything goes through the Internet: without Frisquet's service, Gladys no longer sees the
  boiler (the boiler itself keeps heating normally).
